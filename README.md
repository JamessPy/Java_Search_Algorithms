# Java_Search_Algorithms
In this section, I'll share search algorithms that can be used in Java or any other language. In this repo, I'll be using Java.
I wanted to explain it with images, my current file structure is like this.

Here I wanted to use DFS (Depth-First Search).In this approach, it goes to the depth of the node where
it first started.It takes its name from here.

We can use this search algorithm when we want to search for files with a .pdf extension. 
If we don't think the file we're looking for is deep, or if we want to search sequentially and step by step,
we can use the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm. I'll add that later.

With this structure, we can quickly access the file we're looking for. I wanted to demonstrate this with an example file, but it can be used in many different ways.
